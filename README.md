# SPFX Service Scopes Hooks

This fork takes the great example provided by @vman and takes a "full hooks" approach to simplifying the codebase

- Replaces Class Components with Functional Components
- Removes the Higher Order Component in favour to useContext()
- useEffect() used instead of componentDidMount()
- useState() used instead this.setState()
